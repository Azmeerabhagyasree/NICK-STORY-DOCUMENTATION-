THERE-WAS-ONCE-A-BOY
♧ There was once a 👦 who was growing up in a very wealthy family. One day his father 🧔decided           
to take him on a trip to show how others lived who were less fortunate. His father's goal was to                    
help his son appreciate everything that he has been given in life.                           

♧ The boy and his father pulled up to a farm 🌲🌳🌴🪴🌵🌾☘🍀🌱where very poor family lived. They            
spent several days on the farm, helping the family work for their food and take care of their land.             

♧ When they left the farm, his dad asked his son if he enjoyed their trip and if he had learned              
anything during the time they spent with this other family.                     

♧ The boy quickly replied, "it was fantastic, that family is so lucky ".                  

♧ Confused, his father asked what he meant by that.                         

♧ The boy said "well ,we only have one dog🐕‍🦺, but that family has four 🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺and they have               
chickens🐓🐓🐓. We have four people in our home, but they have 12. They have so many people to              
play with.we have a pool 🏝in our yard,but they have a river🏞 running through their property that                    
is endless. We have lanters outside so we can see at night🌃, but they have the wide open sky and                        
the beautiful stars💥 to give them wonder and light. We have a patio ,but they have the entire                           
horizon to enjoy they have endless fields to run around in and play. We have to go to grocery store,                                 
but they are able to grow their own food. Our high fence protects our property and our family, but                      
they don't need such a limiting structure, because their friends protect them ".

The father was speechless.                    

♧ Finally, the boy added "Thanks you for showing me how rich people live, they're so lucky ".
