**DOCUMENTATION-OF-THE-MAGIC-WAND-**

● Once when emperor Akbar🤴 was holding his royal court, there came a wealthy merchant with a complaint.             
"Your majesty, a pouchful of mygold mohurs💰are missing from my house. U kept it securely in my Almirah in                     
the night 🌃 but in the morning 🌄, i did not find it there. There is nobody in my house except my four              
trusted loyal servants 👨‍🌾👨‍🌾👨‍🌾👨‍🌾. I suspects that one of them has stolen the pouch. But I don't want the                 
innocents to be punished. All of them are pretend their ignorance and it is difficult for me to nab the             
culprit. If I physically thrash each of them, I might lose my three trusted servant as they would surely                                 
resign in protest. I want only the theif to be nabbed without resorting to physical violence".

● The emperor said "well ,it is a complicated case. The normal penal procedure is to thrash and torture            
each of them the real culprit confess his guilt. But that would mean resorting to violence.

● Then the emperor looked meaningful at Birbal 🤴,sitting there in the court .Birbal was quite renowned             
for his sharp intelligence and brilliant wit . The emperor said "Birbal, I refer this cas to you. You                       
solve the case and find the real culprit, without punishing the innocent ".Birbal said "very well , mylord ".

● Then Birbal made enquiries about the four servants and summoned them to his private chamber.Thus each               
of the servants have recorded their statements pleading not guilty. Birbal said "well ,It would have been                  
much better had the culprit owned his guilt. Anyway, I would have to use my magic wands to solve the problems".

● Then Birbal gave each of the servants a wands , saying, "Don't treat it as an ordinary wand . All of u                
should keep it with you for the night and bring it back to me in the morning 🌄. The special quality of                     
this wands is , they would increase their length by three inch if possessed by a thief during the night 🌃".                
Birbal send them away.

● The four servants returned their houses with their wands. The real theif among them thought of a trick                 
to decive Birbal. He thought that he would cut the wand by three inches so that even if it grew by that              
much length, during the night, he wouldn't be caught. So ,he cut it by three inches.

● The next morning 🌄 , the four servants stood before Birbal along with their wands. Birbal could immediately                     
spot the thief.in fact their was nothing "magic " in the wands. They were just ordinary sticks .But the guilty                
conscience of the culprit exposed him. Emperor Akbar immediately summoned the thief and asked him to disclose            
the place where he had hidden the mohurs.

● The thief was constrained to admit his guilt and merchant got back mohurs .All the countries of royal court            
praised Birbal who could find the culprit without resorting to violence..............
