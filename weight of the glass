☆ Once upon a time a psychology professor 👩‍🏫walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles                
to an auditorium filled with students. As she raised a glass of water🧋 ,everyone expected they'd be asked the           
typical"glass half empty or glass half full" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked,                
"How heavy is this glass of water I'm holding?".

☆ Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds.

☆ She replied, "from my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn't matter. It all depends on how long                  
i hold it. If I hold it for a minute or two, it's fairly light. If I hold it for an hour straight,it's weight might                
make my arm ache a little. If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and               
paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the                      
longer i hold it,the heavier it feels to me".

☆ As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued "Your stresses and worries in the life are very much                          
like this glass of water. Thinks about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and you                    
begin to ache a little. Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed incapable of               
doing anything else until you drop them".

☆ The moral : It's important to remember to let go of your stresses and worries. No matter what happens during the day,                      
as early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down. Don't carry them through the night and into next day with                 
you. If you still feel the weight of yesterday's stress ,it's a strong sign that it's time to put the glass down...................
